As a graduation requirement for M.S. non-thesis, I wrote a scholarly paper which was reviewed and
approved by two faculty members from the University of Maryland. The paper was to be ["a concise 
summary of a few research papers published in the open literature."](https://www.ece.umd.edu/sites/default/files/documents/grad/16F-ece-handbook.pdf#page=22)

The topic of the paper was related to a research project that I had done in the Summer of 2016
and continued that Fall as part of an Independent Study, for which I received course credit.
The paper produced as a result of that study will be included in my next post.

Below is the abstract of the scholarly paper:
>Current automobiles exist in a nexus between the mechanical past and the digital future.
>Although cars were once purely mechanical, the modern driver now thinks of car actions and
>events through layers of abstraction, and may have little or no understanding of what actually
>occurs on the press of a pedal or the push of a button. The addition of new vehicle features to
>improve safety, efficiency and convenience requires the integration of Electronic Control Units
>(ECUs) into the vehicle, and as a result the driver has become more removed from the
>mechanics. This paper examines communication between those controllers through the
>Controller Area Network (CAN Bus) protocol, the current standard for in-vehicle communication.
>It goes on to summarize security vulnerabilities through the CAN bus that have been previously
>outlined and discussed in several white papers. Finally, the paper briefly discusses white papers
>on the future of automotive security as we transition into the era of autonomous vehicles.

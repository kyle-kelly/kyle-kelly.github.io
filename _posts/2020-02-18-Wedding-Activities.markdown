## D.C.
For those of you staying in the city, or venturing in for the day, look no further than these activities!

### Cultural 
You'll find all of these between DuPont Circle and the National Mall.

#### The Mansion on O St.
The [location](https://omansion.com/) of one of Eva and Kyle's first dates, and the planned location of the proposal before things went awry. With over 70 hidden rooms and packed full of stuff, this is a great way to spend a few hours. Best to book ahead as walk-ins can have varied levels of success. Entrance fee. 

#### The Renwick Gallery
[Housing](https://americanart.si.edu/visit/renwick) contemporary -- and frankly very strange -- artwork on brief rotations, this museum is located steps from the White House. Free.

#### The Hirshorn Museum
A [must see](https://hirshhorn.si.edu/) for modern art, currently housing Yayoi Kusama. Definitely worth checking out. Free. 

#### The National Gallery of Art
[Comprises](https://www.nga.gov/) an east building, containing modern works, and a west building, containing classical works. Don't miss the underground walkway that ferries you between the two buildings. Free

#### The National Museum of African American History and Culture
A [brand new](https://nmaahc.si.edu/) structure, right on the mall, with splendid views of the Washington Monument. Free.

#### The National Portrait Gallery
Currently most famous for the portraits of [Michelle and Barack Obama](https://npg.si.edu/home/national-portrait-gallery). Stop in for a coffee at the peaceful indoor courtyard. Free. 

#### The National Zoo
Fun for all ages, the [zoo](https://nationalzoo.si.edu/) is accessible from both the Woodley and Cleveland Park Metro stations. Head to Adam's Morgan neighborhood after for some food and drink.

### Food

#### Haikan or Daikaya
Sister restaurants serving up dank ramen in either [Chinatown](http://www.daikaya.com/) or [U. St.](https://www.haikandc.com/) Haikan has a slight edge. 

#### Republic Cantina
A new-ish [restaurant](http://republic-cantina.com/) serving breakfast and dinner. Head over in the morning for breakfast tacos and a coffee, and come back later for the must-have fajitas, margaritas and pico-back shots. 

#### Barcelona
A [tapas bar](https://barcelonawinebar.com/location/14th-street/) with a nice patio. The evenings can be busy so call ahead for best results.

#### Tiger Fork
[Tucked away](https://www.tigerforkdc.com/) in Shaw’s historic Blagden Alley, Tiger Fork offers playful, modern takes on Hong Kong street food, traditional dim sum, and classic Chinese dishes with global influence. Fried rice is V good. 

### Drink

#### Black Jack
Incredible [happy hour](http://www.blackjackdc.com/) (see the food menu) that turns into a solid night. Big enough for large groups.

#### Marvin's
A D.C. [staple](http://www.marvindc.com/). Great crowd in the evenings. 

#### Franklin Hall
Large [beer hall](https://www.franklinhalldc.com/) with hearty bar food. Perfect place to watch a game or play some games. 

#### 18th St. Lounge
Teddy Roosevelt’s [old house](https://www.18thstlounge.com/) provides for a chic venue. Awesome music scene with a sound for everyone. Best on a Thursday or Friday night, or a Sunday session.

#### Dacha
A German-style outdoor [beer garden](https://dachadc.com/beer-garden/) serving up brunch and dinner. Come early to beat the crowd on a nice day. 

#### Sauf Haus
Another [beer hall](http://saufhausdc.com/) right in the heart of DuPont. Plenty of room to get rowdy. 

#### 801
Open-air [top floor](http://801dc.com/) is where it's at. Can get crowded in the evening, so go earlier for best results.

#### Takoda
Also an open-air [top floor](https://www.takodadc.com/), but the second floor is very hospitable too.

#### Calico
[Located](https://www.calicodc.com/) in Shaw’s Blagden Alley, Calico is an Urban backyard bar and restaurant, with easygoing drinks in a sceney patio & country-chic room.

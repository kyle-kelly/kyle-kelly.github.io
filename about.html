<p>Hey! My name is Kyle and I’m an engineer located in Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Here are some things I like:</p>
<ul>
  <li>coffee</li>
  <li>beer (ales and lagers, mostly)</li>
  <li>riding my bike around the city</li>
  <li>going for a run (I believe it’s “jogging” or “yogging.” It might be a soft “j”.)</li>
  <li>gorging on popcorn while watching a movie</li>
</ul>

<p>Here are some things I don’t like so much:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Maggie Gyllenhaal in the Dark Knight</li>
  <li>when I sneeze and a person says something in acknowledgement of my sneeze</li>
  <li>cantaloupe</li>
</ul>

<p>I have a M.S. and B.S. in Electrical Engineering from the University of Maryland and The Ohio State University, respectively. I enjoy embedded systems and do most of my coding in C or Python.</p>
